# mini game site

## Plan

The plan for this site is to have a home page with links to a few different mini games. I will use these mini games to demonstate different abilities I have. Each of these mini games will have a solve button or something similar. The solve buttons will be the main focus of my coding ability.
At the moment I plan to have at least two games, one being sudoku, with a naive backtracking algorithim, and a smart backtracking algorithim, the other being a flappy bird, or similar platformer, using a 1 to 2 layer neural network as the "solver".
For both games I plan to use just plain html, css, and javascript although for the neural network I may have to use python. But for the visuals I plan to not use any external libaries.
